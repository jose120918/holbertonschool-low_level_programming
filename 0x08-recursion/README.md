## Learning Objectives:bowtie:
What you should learn from this project:

* What is recursion
* How to implement recursion
* In what situations you should implement recursion
* In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion

### [0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget](./0-puts_recursion.c) :grimacing:
* Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.


### [1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together](./1-print_rev_recursion.c) :cloud:
* Write a function that prints a string in reverse.


### [2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange](./2-strlen_recursion.c) :sunny:
* Write a function that returns the length of a string.


### [3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling](./3-factorial.c) :sunflower:
* Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.


### [4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate](./4-pow_recursion.c) :fireworks:
* Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.


### [5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer](./5-sqrt_recursion.c):ghost:
* Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.


### [6. Inception. Is it possible?](./6-is_prime_number.c) :eyes:
* Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.


### [7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything](./7-is_palindrome.c) :sleeping:
* Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.


### [8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...](./100-wildcmp.c) :dancers:
* Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
