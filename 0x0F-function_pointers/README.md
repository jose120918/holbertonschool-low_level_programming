* Write a function that prints a name.


### [1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done](./1-array_iterator.c)
* Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.


### [2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities](./2-int_index.c)
* Write a function that searches for an integer.


### [3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at](./3-main.c)
* Write a program that performs simple operations.


### [4. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker](./100-main_opcodes.c)
* Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.
